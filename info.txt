problem:
[ts] Cannot find name 'require'. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31173738/typescript-getting-error-ts2304-cannot-find-name-require)
solution 1 - quick and dirty ->   declare var require: any
solution 2 - proper -> npm install @types/node --save-dev


problem:
[ts] 'Map' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
include in compilerOptions:        "lib": [
            "es2016"
        ]


problem:
typescript returns 'object | undefined' - for example when doing a _.find.   This makes sense but we now have to constantly 
check for undefined also deeper in the code after the check has already been done (in fat-arrow functions)
solution: 
    "strictNullChecks": false,

problem:
window.addEventListener("keydown", function (event: any) {...     [ts] Cannot find name 'window'.
solution:  "lib": [
            "es2016", "dom"                     add the "dom"
        ]
